"""
This code is designed to iterate through a list of router credentials and print the IP interface brief information for each router. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:
Import Module: It imports the routers module, which presumably contains the necessary functions and data for handling router credentials and commands.
Iterate Through Routers: It loops through each router in the routers.creds list. This list likely contains dictionaries with the credentials and connection details for each router.
Print IP Interface Brief: For each router, it calls the routers.get_ip_int_br function, passing the router's credentials using the **router syntax to unpack the dictionary. This function presumably connects to the router and retrieves the IP interface brief information. The result is then printed.
Print Separator: After printing the IP interface brief information for each router, it prints a line of 80 dashes to separate the output for each router.
In summary, this code connects to multiple routers using their credentials, retrieves the IP interface brief information for each router, and prints the information with a separator line between each router's output.
