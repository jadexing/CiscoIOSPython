"""
This code is designed to connect to a Cisco IOS device, retrieve the IP interface brief information, and extract the configuration details of the GigabitEthernet1 interface. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:
Import Libraries: It imports the netmiko library for network device communication and the re library for regular expression operations.
Device Connection Details: It sets up the connection details for the Cisco IOS device, including the IP address, username, password, device type, and port.
Connect to Device: It establishes a connection to the Cisco IOS device using the provided credentials and connection details.
Retrieve IP Interface Brief: It sends the show ip interface brief command to the device to retrieve the IP interface brief information and stores it in the csr1kv1_ip_int_br variable.
Regular Expression Pattern: It defines a regular expression pattern to match the configuration details of the GigabitEthernet1 interface.
Extract Configuration Details: It uses the re.search function to search for the GigabitEthernet1 interface configuration details in the IP interface brief information. If found, it prints the matched configuration details.
