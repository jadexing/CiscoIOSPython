"""
This code is designed to connect to a Cisco IOS device, retrieve the hostname from the device's running configuration, and print the results. However, due to the break statement, the loop will exit after the first iteration. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:
Import Library: It imports the netmiko library, which is used for network device communication.
Initialize Variables: It initializes the variable last_octet to 1. This variable will be used to iterate through the last octet of the IP addresses.
While Loop: It enters a while loop that continues as long as last_octet is less than or equal to 3.
Skip First Iteration and Exit Loop: If last_octet is 1, it increments last_octet by 1 and prints a message indicating that the loop exited with a break statement. The break statement then exits the loop, so the rest of the code inside the loop will not be executed.
Construct IP Address: If the loop were to continue, it would construct the IP address by concatenating the base IP 10.254.0. with the current value of last_octet.
Connect to Device: It would establish a connection to the Cisco IOS device at the constructed IP address using the provided credentials (username and password).
Retrieve Hostname: It would send the command show run | include hostname to the device to retrieve the hostname from the running configuration and print the result.
Print Separator: It would print a separator line of 20 underscores to visually separate the output for each device.
Increment Last Octet: It would increment last_octet by 1 and repeat the process for the next IP address.
In summary, due to the break statement, the loop exits after the first iteration, and the code to connect to the device and retrieve the hostname is not executed.
