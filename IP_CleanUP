"""
This code is designed to remove duplicate IP addresses from a list and then print the unique IP addresses in sorted order. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:
Import Library: It imports the netmiko library, although it is not used in this specific code snippet.
Define IP Addresses: It defines a list of IP addresses, ip_addrs, which contains some duplicate entries.
Remove Duplicates: It converts the list of IP addresses into a set, ip_addrs_unique, which automatically removes any duplicate entries because sets do not allow duplicates.
Sort and Print: It sorts the unique IP addresses and prints them in ascending order.
In summary, this code takes a list of IP addresses, removes any duplicates, and prints the unique IP addresses in sorted order.
