"""
This code is designed to connect to multiple Cisco IOS devices, retrieve the hostname from each device's running configuration, and print the results. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:
Import Library: It imports the netmiko library, which is used for network device communication.
Initialize Variables: It initializes the variable last_octet to 1. This variable will be used to iterate through the last octet of the IP addresses.
While Loop: It enters a while loop that continues as long as last_octet is less than or equal to 3.
Skip First Iteration: If last_octet is 1, it increments last_octet by 1 and continues to the next iteration, effectively skipping the first IP address (10.254.0.1).
Construct IP Address: It constructs the IP address by concatenating the base IP 10.254.0. with the current value of last_octet.
Connect to Device: It establishes a connection to the Cisco IOS device at the constructed IP address using the provided credentials (username and password).
Retrieve Hostname: It sends the command show run | include hostname to the device to retrieve the hostname from the running configuration and prints the result.
Print Separator: It prints a separator line of 20 underscores to visually separate the output for each device.
Increment Last Octet: It increments last_octet by 1 and repeats the process for the next IP address.
In summary, this code connects to Cisco IOS devices with IP addresses 10.254.0.2 and 10.254.0.3, retrieves their hostnames, and prints the results with separators between each device's output.
