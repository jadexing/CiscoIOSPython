"""
This code is designed to connect to a Cisco IOS device, retrieve the ARP table, and extract MAC addresses from it. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:
Import Libraries: It imports the netmiko library for network device communication and the re library for regular expression operations.
Device Connection Details: It sets up the connection details for the Cisco IOS device, including the IP address, username, password, device type, and port.
Connect to Device: It establishes a connection to the Cisco IOS device using the provided credentials and connection details.
Retrieve ARP Table: It sends the show arp command to the device to retrieve the ARP table and stores the output in the show_arp variable. This output is then printed.
Extract MAC Addresses: It uses a regular expression to find all MAC addresses in the ARP table that match the pattern xxxx.xxxx.xxxx and stores them in the mac_list variable. These MAC addresses are then printed.
In summary, this code connects to a Cisco IOS device, retrieves the ARP table, and extracts and prints the MAC addresses from it.
